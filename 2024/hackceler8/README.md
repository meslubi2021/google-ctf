# Hackceler8 2024 Game

`handout/` is the version of the game that will be handed out during the game rounds. `server/` is the version that will run on the organizers' server. The only difference is the content of some files under game/components/boss.

See the README.md in the respective folders for setting up and running the game client + server.
