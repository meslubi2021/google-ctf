Bring seafood stock to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and keep the stock barely at a simmer. Heat olive oil in a large paella pan or a large heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add cup vermicelli noodles and toast, stirring with a wooden spoon to toast them evenly, until golden. Transfer the toasted fideos to a bowl and set aside.

Increase the heat to medium-high and add olive oil. Add shrimps in a single layer and cook until seared. Remove to a plate and set aside.

Add olive oil to the pan and add the diced onion. Cook until itâ€™s soft and translucent. Add the squid and cook until the onions and squid are a deep golden brown.
