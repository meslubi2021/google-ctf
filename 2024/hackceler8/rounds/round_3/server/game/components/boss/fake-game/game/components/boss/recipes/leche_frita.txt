Whisk cornstarch, sugar, and half of the flour until they're well combined. Add milk and whisk until blended, then set aside. Heat the milk in a saucepan, then add the cinnamon stick, lemon peel, and vanilla and let it sit. Strain the milk mixture into the cornstarch-milk mixture.

Oil a large baking dish and pour the mixture into it. Cover with plastic wrap and let it chill. Turn the cooled milk mixture out of the pan and cut into small squares. Dip each piece in beaten egg, then in flour, to bread it. Heat the olive oil over medium heat. Fry the coated pieces in the oil until golden. Stir the sugar and cinnamon together, then toss the leche frita in the cinnamon sugar.

Serve the leche frita fresh - preferably with ice cream!
