Heat oil over high heat in a cast iron skillet, then add peppers. Cook without moving until blistered on first side. Flip and shake the peppers and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until well blistered. Season with salt.

Transfer peppers to a serving plate. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with more coarse salt. Serve immediately.
