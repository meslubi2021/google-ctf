Peel and cut potatoes. Place in a large pot and cover with water. Bring them to the boil over high heat and simmer them. Drain and roast in a preheated oven. Shake twice through the roasting process for the potatoes to cook evenly. Sprinkle sweet paprika over the top before serving.

In a small saucepan, fry bay leaf, onion and garlic. Add paprika, chili flakes, oregano and fry before adding sugar, sherry vinegar and chopped tomato tin. Let it cook, then add water and simmer on low heat. Blitz until smooth.

Serve with generous salsa brava over the top, a few dollops of alioli and a sprinkle of the parsley. Enjoy!
